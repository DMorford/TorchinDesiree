# TorchinDesiree 🔥

*Where RTX 5070 meets PyTorch in a beautiful (painful) dance of compilation*

This is the raw, no-fluff build log for getting PyTorch running with CUDA on an RTX 5070 GPU—nicknamed *Desiree*. If you're trying to make AI sing on a brand-new card and your install keeps crying, you're in the right place.

## 🎯 The Mission

To successfully compile PyTorch with full GPU acceleration using CUDA 12.x for the RTX 5070 (Blackwell architecture). Along the way, we document what works, what doesn't, and what almost made us throw the machine out a window.

## 🛠️ What's Inside This Repo

- **CUDA and PyTorch version compatibility matrices** - Because version hell is real
- **CMake configurations and build scripts** - The good, the bad, and the "why did I try that"
- **Complete dependency installation guides** - Step-by-step for fellow beginners  
- **Environment setup for Windows 11** - Because GPU builds are OS-specific nightmares
- **All the failed builds** - And how we fixed (or cursed at) them
- **Success stories** - When things finally work, we celebrate!

## 💻 Desiree's Specs

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **GPU** | NVIDIA RTX 5070 (12GB VRAM, Blackwell sm_120) |
| **CPU** | Intel Core i9-14900F (24 cores: 8P + 16E) |
| **RAM** | 32GB DDR5 |
| **OS** | Windows 11 x64 (fresh install) |
| **Python** | 3.11.9 (optimal for PyTorch builds) |
| **Target** | PyTorch built from source with CUDA acceleration |

## 🚀 Current Status

- ✅ **Phase 1:** Environment setup (CUDA 12.3 → 12.9 journey)
- ✅ **Phase 2:** Build automation scripts created  
- 🔥 **Phase 3:** PyTorch compilation attempts (ongoing)
- ⏳ **Phase 4:** Success celebration (pending)

## 🤘 Why "Desiree"?

Because this machine is the heartbeat of a bigger vision—running AI avatars, local LLMs, and wild multimedia magic. She's the rockstar behind the curtain powering an amazing project. This repo just captures the warmup act before the main show.

Think of it as the technical prequel to something much cooler. 🎬

## 🔧 For Fellow Builders

If you're tackling a similar build with RTX 50xx series cards:

1. **Start here:** Check our `environment-setup/` for the prerequisites
2. **Grab our scripts:** The `build-scripts/` folder has automation for different approaches
3. **Learn from our pain:** Browse `build-logs/` to see what didn't work
4. **Check compatibility:** Our `compatibility-notes/` might save you hours

## 🎓 Learning Philosophy

This repo assumes you're learning too. We explain the "why" behind our choices, not just the "what." Every major decision, failed build, and breakthrough is documented with context.

No gatekeeping, no assumed knowledge—just honest documentation of the journey.
